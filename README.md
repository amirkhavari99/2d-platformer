# 2d-platformer
This is a simple 2d platformer game.

You have a player with visuals of a Ninja Frog and your goal is to eat all of the Melons in the level and then reach the final checkpoint of the game.
You can restart your level when the level is completed.
You cannot lose in this game, I challenge you xD

This project is configured to run on the Windows platform for now, you need a keyboard if you want to play the game. Subsequent versions will also support onscreen buttons for Android and iOS.

If you want to build the game with Unity, follow these steps:
1. Clone the project from Github
2. Open the project with Unity (preferably the latest version of Unity v2021.3)
3. Go to File -> Build Settings
4. Hit Build
5. Provide a destination folder
6. Wait for the build to finish
7. Run 2D-Platformer.exe in the folder you specified earlier.
8. Enjoy

Also, there's already a built version of the last commit in the Assets/Builds/ folder.
